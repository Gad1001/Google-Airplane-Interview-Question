# Google-Airplane-Interview-Question
Just stumbled across a video in youtube that claims a certain question to be a programing question which on a google interview the interviewer wouldnt expect it to be fully solved and fully coede out, and would expect them to strugle maybe get a potenial solution code out some of it and give a lot of hints.
Sooo tried it and don't understand what is the big deal

This is my super simple solution to Google Airplane Interview Question.
it is probably unoptimized solution and a lot of grammar mistakes but short one

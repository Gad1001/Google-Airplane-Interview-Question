# Google-Airplane-Interview-Question
Just stumbled across a video in youtube that showed a certain programing question and said that in a google interview the interviewer wouldnt expect it to be fully solved and fully coede out, and would expect them to strugle maybe get a potenial solution code out some of it and give a lot of hints.
Sooo... tried it and not that complicated :)

This is a simple solution to the Google Airplane Connections Interview Question.
BTW it is probably unoptimized solution and a lot of grammar mistakes but short one
